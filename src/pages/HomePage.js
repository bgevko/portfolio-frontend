                    <h3>WELCOME TO MY HOME PAGE</h3>
                    <p>Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at Oregon State University. I love technology, and my primary interests are web development, mobile development, UI/UX design, graphics programming, digital signal processing, machine learning, and game development. </p>
                    
                    <p>I designed this site in Figma and brought it to life using React, Node, Express, and MongoDB. My goal was to have a visually appealing and functional website accessible and responsive on all devices. I implemented a basic markdown content management system that allows me to add, edit, and remove blog posts directly with my custom UI, which I built from scratch.</p>

                    <p>My primary career goal is to graduate and then find work in one of the fields that I listed above. I think having diverse exposure to different aspects of technology is a crucial part of any Computer Science curriculum. I love learning, and I hope that my curiosity will guide me to a fruitful software developer career. </p>
                        
                    <p>Thanks for visiting my website!</p>
